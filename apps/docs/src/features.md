## Some highlighted features

### Kanji View

The Kanji page show your other notes that use the same kanji. You can also see notes that use similar kanji and deep dive into the note itself.
This feature requires notes cache generated from the [Kiku Note Manager](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/408592650?cb=1763445474367) addon.
If the notes cache is not available, it will uses [AnkiConnect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159) as fallback.
